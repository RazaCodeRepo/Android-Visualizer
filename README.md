# Android-Visualizer

This app draws a graphic visualizer that displays the bass, range and quality of any given song fed into the app.
The user has the option of toggling between any of these characteristics and modifying the degree of animation of the visualizer.

A demo video of the app is available here: https://youtu.be/llxP5SZUL1U
